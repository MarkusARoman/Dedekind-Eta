# Dedekind-Eta

GitHub Streak (II)

What you're seeing:

Poincaré Disk:
The input domain is the unit disk. 
Each point on the screen is seen as a complex number.

Upper Half-Plane Mapping:
Each complex point is mapped using a Möbius transform.

Dedekind Eta Function:
A famous complex modular form is evaluated numerically.

Color Scheme:
- Hue encodes the argument (angle) of the eta function.
- Value encodes the magnitude.
- Saturation fluctuates with the log-magnitude bands to reveal periodic structures.

Anti-Aliasing:
Soft edge falloff using smoothstep for better visual blending.
